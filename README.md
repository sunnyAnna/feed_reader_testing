# Feed Reader Testing

Jasmine-based test suites for a RSS feed reader app.

### INSTRUCTIONS

The project is being hosted on [this page](https://sunnyanna.github.io/testSuites).

Check the test suites in the Jasmine Reporter element at the bottom of the page.
All of the tests are automatically run upon initial page load.
Clicking on an individual test will run the chosen test.

### GOALS

Write test suites and tests to ensure that:

1. Feeds have defined and non-empty names and urls.

2. Menu is hidden by default and changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked on.

3. There's at least one feed entry present on the page.

4. The loadFeed function changes the feed content.

5. Tests run independently from each other.

6. All of the tests pass.
